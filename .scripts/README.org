#+TITLE: My scripts
#+STARTUP: overview

Here is a small collection of shell scripts which I have written to automate some common tasks. They should all be POSIX-compliant and therefore usable with a faster shell such as =dash=.

* System

- =adjust-volume=

  This is called by XMonad whenever I want, but can also be used to control the speakers from the command line.
  I can use =adjust-volume toggle= to toggle mute, and =adjust-volume +n= or =adjust-volume -n= to increase or decrease the volume by a certain amount =n=.

* Menus

Many of these scripts are based around menus. I can hit a certain key combination to run a script, which gives me a menu and an action based on the option I select. The program used to display the menu depends on an argument. I usually use =rofi=, and therefore pass =rofi -dmenu -i -p= as the argument.

- =menu-change-colourscheme=

  Selects and applies a systemwide (currently only alacritty and neovim) colourscheme using the =colourscheme= script.

- =menu-edit-config=

  Opens the selected config file in a text editor specified by the second argument.

- =menu-edit-script=

  Displays a list of all files in my =.scripts= directory. The selected file is opened in the text editor specified by the second argument.
  
- =menu-read-pdf=

  Displays a list of PDF files on my system. The selected file is opened in Zathura or an alternative text editor specified by the second argument. The list of PDF files is automatically generated by searching my =Downloads= and =Documents= directories each time the script is run. Particular effort was made to nicely display files without extensions or common directory names, as well as to support filenames containing whitespace. I use this script many times a day when working.
